## 📋 Overview

**Resilio** is an intelligent decision-support platform designed for Supply Chain Analysts and Business Operations Managers. By leveraging Generative AI (Google Gemini), it transforms raw supplier data into actionable risk intelligence, enabling proactive supply chain resilience strategies.

## 🎯 The Business Problem

Global supply chains face unprecedented volatility from non-linear shocks including geopolitical conflicts, environmental disasters, labor strikes, and regulatory changes. Traditional analytics dashboards excel at showing *what happened*, but fall short in answering critical questions:

- **What could happen?** Predictive risk modeling
- **How should we respond?** Strategic mitigation planning
- **Where are we most vulnerable?** Multi-dimensional risk assessment

Resilio bridges this gap by combining structured data analysis with AI-powered scenario planning.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Intelligent Inventory Diagnostics
Automated risk scoring engine that evaluates suppliers across four critical dimensions:
- **Geopolitical Risk**: Country stability, trade restrictions, sanctions exposure
- **Operational Risk**: Lead time variability, supplier reliability, production capacity
- **Financial Risk**: Vendor health, payment terms, spend concentration
- **Environmental Risk**: Climate vulnerability, sustainability compliance, ESG factors

### 🧪 Scenario Optimization Lab
Interactive "What-If" simulation engine that models the impact of:
- Port closures and logistics disruptions
- Trade policy changes and tariff implementations
- Natural disasters and climate events
- Supplier bankruptcies and capacity constraints
- Currency fluctuations and commodity price shocks

### 📊 Actionable Mitigation Playbooks
AI-generated strategic recommendations tailored to your network vulnerabilities:
- **Diversification Strategies**: Multi-sourcing recommendations with cost-benefit analysis
- **Buffer Stocking**: Optimized safety stock calculations based on risk exposure
- **Nearshoring Opportunities**: Regional supplier alternatives with trade-off analysis
- **Contract Restructuring**: Terms optimization for high-risk suppliers

### 📈 Dynamic Risk Visualization
Real-time interactive dashboards featuring:
- Multi-dimensional risk radar charts
- Geographic spend concentration heatmaps
- Supplier criticality matrices
- Trend analysis and early warning indicators
