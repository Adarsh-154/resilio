**Transform supplier data into strategic risk intelligence with AI**

</div>

---

## 📋 Overview

**Resilio** is an intelligent decision-support platform designed for Supply Chain Analysts and Business Operations Managers. By leveraging Generative AI (Google Gemini), it transforms raw supplier data into actionable risk intelligence, enabling proactive supply chain resilience strategies.

## 🎯 The Business Problem

Global supply chains face unprecedented volatility from geopolitical conflicts, environmental disasters, labor strikes, and regulatory changes. Traditional analytics dashboards excel at showing *what happened*, but fail to answer:

- **What could happen?** → Predictive risk modeling
- **How should we respond?** → Strategic mitigation planning  
- **Where are we most vulnerable?** → Multi-dimensional risk assessment

Resilio bridges this gap by combining structured data analysis with AI-powered scenario planning.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

**Intelligent Risk Diagnostics** - Automated scoring across Geopolitical, Operational, Financial, and Environmental factors with real-time radar visualizations and spend concentration maps.

**Scenario Optimization Lab** - Interactive "What-If" engine simulating port closures, trade policy changes, supplier bankruptcies, and climate events on your specific supplier network.

**AI-Generated Mitigation Playbooks** - Strategic recommendations including diversification strategies, optimized buffer stocking, nearshoring opportunities, and contract restructuring based on network vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React (TypeScript) | Component-based UI architecture |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first responsive design |
| **Data Visualization** | Recharts | D3-powered interactive charts |
| **AI Engine** | Google Gemini Flash | Structured reasoning and scenario analysis |
| **Prompt Engineering** | JSON Schema Validation | Reliable, parseable AI outputs |

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Procurement Teams**: Identify high-risk suppliers before contract renewals
- **Operations Managers**: Simulate disruption scenarios and prepare contingency plans
- **Supply Chain Analysts**: Generate executive reports on network vulnerabilities
- **Strategic Planning**: Evaluate nearshoring vs. offshoring trade-offs
